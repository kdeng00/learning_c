The source material used to learn C is from *The C Programming Language 2nd Edition by Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kerningham*. The reason I chose this book is due to numerous programmers acknowledging this as a well put together book explaining the language. The book is concise and achieves the objective of exhibiting how the language can be used and inspires further advancement. Though C is a small language this book serves as a good read to get acquainted. There aren't vast examples or tirades delving into painstakingly detailed concepts. It's a good introductory book. Even more, I get to learn C as C. Instead of falling into the trap when learning a new language without getting used to it. I know C++ but C shouldn't be viewed as C++ without all of the extra stuff. After all, C++ was originally meant to be a subset of C but never did.
